Collection Service Episode..

So theres a KillBreaks, three of them and what you would likely think is that it has 3 scripts, but were not gonna do that instead
were gonna do it in 1 script so its not complicated.

GetTagged()
SO what you need to do is that you need to add a tag editor and give all the parts a tag and that tag is gonna be use for function
for making it function just like i said to not complicate some stuff

SCRIPT FOR IT..
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local sound = game.StarterGui.GuiMusic.Scream

local killBricks = CollectionService:GetTagged("KillBricks")

for i,killBrick in pairs(killBricks) do
	killBrick.Touched:Connect(function(touched)
		local human = touched.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

		if human then
			sound:Play()
			human.Health = 0
		end
	end)
end

GetTags() & GetAllTags()
theres actually a tag property on a part that you can put a name into it
you can add as many as you want and theres one on mine its called "KillBricks" its the tag which i USED in the SCRIPTER
