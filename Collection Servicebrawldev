Collection Service Episode..

So theres a KillBreaks, three of them and what you would likely think is that it has 3 scripts, but were not gonna do that instead
were gonna do it in 1 script so its not complicated.

GetTagged()
SO what you need to do is that you need to add a tag editor and give all the parts a tag and that tag is gonna be use for function
for making it function just like i said to not complicate some stuff

SCRIPT FOR IT..
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local sound = game.StarterGui.GuiMusic.Scream

local killBricks = CollectionService:GetTagged("KillBricks")

for i,killBrick in pairs(killBricks) do
	killBrick.Touched:Connect(function(touched)
		local human = touched.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

		if human then
			sound:Play()
			human.Health = 0
		end
	end)
end

GetTags() & GetAllTags()
GetTags()..
theres actually a tag property on a part that you can put a name into it
you can add as many as you want and theres one on mine its called "KillBricks" its the tag which i USED in the SCRIPTER
SCRIPT
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local sound = game.StarterGui.GuiMusic.Scream

local killBricks = CollectionService:GetTagged("KillBricks")

for i,killBrick in pairs(killBricks) do
	killBrick.Touched:Connect(function(touched)
		local human = touched.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

		if human then
			sound:Play()
			human.Health = 0
		end
	end)
end

local partTags = CollectionService:GetTags(game.Workspace.KillBrick1)
for i,tag in pairs(partTags) do
	print(tag)
end

GetAllTags()
this is kind of a global thing
so in our GetTags example this told us to get tags from a specific instance but what if we wanted to just get all the tags that are available inside of the game.

SCRIPT..
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local sound = game.StarterGui.GuiMusic.Scream

local killBricks = CollectionService:GetTagged("KillBricks")

for i,killBrick in pairs(killBricks) do
	killBrick.Touched:Connect(function(touched)
		local human = touched.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

		if human then
			sound:Play()
			human.Health = 0
		end
	end)
end

local partTags = CollectionService:GetTags(game.Workspace.KillBrick1)
for i,tag in pairs(partTags) do
	print(tag)
end

local allTags = CollectionService:GetAllTags()
for i,tag in pairs(allTags) do
	print(tag)
end
                                                                Output:
                                   KillBricks  -  Server - CollectionService:19
                                   KillBricks  -  Server - CollectionService:24
                                   TagEditorTagContainer  -  Server - CollectionService:24
But the GetTagged() is really one of the useful thing

AddTag() & RemoveTag()
SCRIPT..
You need to add a specific tag name and put that tag into this script its located at the second word (newpart, "thisisthetag")

task.wait(7)

local newPart = game.Workspace:WaitForChild("NewBlock")
CollectionService:AddTag(newPart, "KillBricks")

task.wait(5)

CollectionService:RemoveTag(newPart, "KillBricks")

There's a another function that if were looking for a specific tag so lets say that after we add in a tag for our new part let's
make a check this this newPart still has the "KillBrick" tag

SCRIPT..
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local sound = game.StarterGui.GuiMusic.Scream

local killBricks = CollectionService:GetTagged("KillBricks")

for i,killBrick in pairs(killBricks) do
	killBrick.Touched:Connect(function(touched)
		local human = touched.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

		if human then
			sound:Play()
			human.Health = 0
		end
	end)
end

CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal("KillBricks"):Connect(function()
	print("killbrick has been added to the collection")
end)

CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal("KillBricks"):Connect(function()
	print("killbrick has been removed from the collection")
end)
