global sounds means both server and local can hear the sound

local sounds means ONLY local means the player only not the SERVER can hear the sound

Promixity Sounds
This sound can only be heared in a game, so the farther you are from it, the lesser the sound is
but when your closer to it the louder the sound it gets.
IT ONLY WORKS WITH PARTS & ATTACHMENTS
IT NEEDS TO BE A SERVER SCRIPT NOT A LOCAL SCRIPT

SOUNDSERVICE AND SOUND GROUPS
TO PUT A SOUND GROUP JUST HIT THE PLUS SIGN ON THE SOUND SERVICE THEN SEARCH SOUND GROUP AND CLICK ON IT...
THIS IS GOOD FOR YOUR GAME OR PROJECTS BECAUSE IF YOU WANT A CERTAIN SOUND TO PLAY YOU CAN JUST
CALL THE SOUND ITSELF ACCORDINGLY
SCRIPT FOR IT

local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
local musicGroup = SoundService:WaitForChild("Music")

local randomNum = math.random(1, #musicGroup:GetChildren())
local randomSound = musicGroup:GetChildren()[randomNum]

randomSound:Play()

SOUNDSERVICE VOLUME AND GROUPS VOLUME
