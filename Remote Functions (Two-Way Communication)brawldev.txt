This Project is called REMOTE FUNCTION for a 2 way communication
This is a method where you go from the client to the server and then back to the client.

1st one: the client sends information to the server and the server sends information back to the client
example the player can't purchase the item because he only has 45 pesos and it cost 50, so the server sent the
information to the client and the client send it back to the server

THE SCRIPT FOR LEADERSTATS

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(playr)
local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder", playr)
leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"

local pesos = Instance.new("IntValue",  leaderstats)
pesos.Name = "Pesos"
pesos.Value = 55
end)

local remotefunction = game.ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.BoughtButton

remotefunction.OnServerInvoke = function(playr)
    local purchaseSuccess = false

local leaderstats = playr.leaderstats
local pesos = leaderstats.Pesos

if pesos.Value >= 50 then
    pesos.Value -= 50
    purchaseSuccess = true
   end

   return purchaseSuccess
end

LOCAL SCRIPT FOR THE GUI

local remotefunction = game.ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.BoughtButton

local gui = script.Parent
local prompt = gui.Prompt
local button = gui.BuyingOn

button.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	local purchaseSuccess = remotefunction:InvokeServer()

	if purchaseSuccess then
	prompt.Text = "Purchase SUCCESSFUL!"
	prompt.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)
		task.wait(3.5)
	prompt.Text = "Would you Like to Buy this button"
	prompt.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255)
	else
		prompt.Text = "Purchase FAILED!"
		prompt.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)
		task.wait(3.5)
	prompt.Text = "Would you Like to Buy this button"
	prompt.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255)
	end    
end)    

This PROJECT is called EVENT VS CALLBACK a ANOTHER METHOD
This method is From the SERVER to the CLIENT and then back to the server.
This is not really RECOMMENDED
