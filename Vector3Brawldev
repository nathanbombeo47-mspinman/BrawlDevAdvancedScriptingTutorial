Vector3 Episode....
Vector3 is basically a value that allows us to manipulate specific properties inside our 3D World
X means for FORWARD AND BACKWARD Y means for UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE and Z means for SIDEWAYS AND BACKWAYS

THE SCRIPT

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    task.wait(1.4)
    local humanoidpart = player.Character:WaitForChild("HumanoidRootPart")
	humanoidpart.Position = game.Workspace.TeleportPart.Position + Vector3.new(0, 5, 0)
end)

local part = game.Workspace.Part
part.Orientation = Vector3.new(90, 9, 8)
end

THATS PRETTY MUCH IT OF WHAT I LEARNED
