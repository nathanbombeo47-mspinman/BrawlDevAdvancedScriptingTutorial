local tool = script.Parent

tool.Equipped:Connect(function()
	print("this tool has been equipped")
end)

tool.Unequipped:Connect(function()
	print("this tool has been unequipped")
end)

tool.Activated:Connect(function()
	print("tool has been activated")
end)

tool.Deactivated:Connect(function()
	print("tool has been deactivated")
end)

so activated means like when you click on mouse left click and for other devices like mobile, xbox, etc and
deactivated means when you let go of the clicking tapping.

equipped means when you equip the tool and unequipped means you unequip it
