i am officially learning from chatgpt not from brawldev i think this is more kind of effective FOR ME not all of the people i don't find it enjoyable
learning for brawldev thats why i don't wanna learn from it

i like more chatgpt because in less than 10 minute i already know how modulce scripts work
Ex: i have a module on the folder ServicesM&Remotes and that folder is inside of ReplicatedStorage and that module acts as a toolbox
and the script is the User of the toolbox.

this script is the User of the toolbox
local killbrick = require(game.ReplicatedStorage["ServicesM&Remotes"].KillBrick)

local part = game.Workspace.killpart
killbrick.KillOnTouch(part)

this is the module which the toolbox
local killbrick = {}

function killbrick.KillOnTouch(part)
    part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    local character = hit.Parent
    local humanoid = character:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

    if humanoid then
        humanoid.Health = 0

        end
    end)
end

return killbrick
done..
