1.UserInputService is mainly used for clicking to your keyboard so it means you can't do it on mobile.
2.InputBegan is a keyboard sensor that listens to every button the human clicked.
3.Clicked is the keybind which means if you require the script to function when a certain Keybind is
  needed to be click like most of keyboard's buttons, like if you click Q it will function.
4.KeyCode is the statement for the scripter to decide which button on the keyboard will be click.
5.Gprocessed is the listener if the player touches any gui like chat, add, gui, etc.
6.InputEnded is a function when the human takes his finger from holding the button.
7.UserInputType is a thing that can be click by Mouse/PC, Touch/Phone and Gamepad/Xbox.
  Like Mouse1, Mouse2, Mouse3, Touch and Gamepad.
8.TouchEnabled, MouseEnabled and VREnabled are the devices from which devices you play on TouchEnabled is
  for Mobile, MouseEnabled is for PC, and VREnabled is for XBOX.
9.JumpRequest is just a function that fires when a player jumps, and if you only put like a function without
  any if boolean it will not work i've done this and i forgot how it's done and now my confusion is the boolean
  itself so like you need to put local switch = false to always false because if you do choose true it will
  double out and crashes, so like the if should be correct to so put if not switch then and that will work.
10.Tick() is mainly used for a ability or keybind will function if clicked twice, so you need to put things like
   make variable-- local TICK = tick()
   if clicked.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.T and (tick() - TICK <= 0.2) then
   end
   TICK = tick()
